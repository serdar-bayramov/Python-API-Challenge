3 Observable Trends for Pert 1:

1. The data clearly shows the relationship between temperature and change in latitude in southern and northern hemispheres. Clearly, the northern and southern poles have the lowest temperatures.
2. There was no clear evidence that cloudiness and humidity change with change of latitude in the northern hemisphere, as the data is extremely scattered. However, there is some evidence, despite low, that wind speed drops with incrrease of latitude in norhtern hemisphere.
3. In southern hemisphere, there is some correlation that cloudiness increases with increase of latitude and there is minor reduction of humidity as latitude moves towards zero.
